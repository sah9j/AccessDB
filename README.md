# How to Run Program
If you have Microsoft Office365, you should have an application called "Microsoft Access". If it is not present on your computer or online, then you can go to
https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/access. You can download it from there and try it for free. 

Once you have it downloaded, you can simply double click on the program, and it should automatically run on its own. You don't need to compile it or anything.
